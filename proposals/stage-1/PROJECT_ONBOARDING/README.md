# Project Onboarding Checklist Proposal
> Stage 1

## Champion

Jory Burson (@jorydotcom) & Michael Dawson (@mhdawson)

## Description

Proposal creates a checklist artifact to be used to onboard projects that have been accepted into the OpenJS Foundation.

## Required Resources

Discussion/approval by bootstrap committee

## Who would be responsible?

This document would belong to the CPC to update and use moving forward.

## How would success be measured?

Initially we should measure this document's success by how well it helps us onboard our current projects into the new Foundation system. We expect that it might also be successfully used to help would-be foundation projects understand what to expect after joining.

## Why this proposal is important

We need to share a workflow and understanding of what steps are required to bring in projects to the OpenJS Foundation. This checklist is an attempt to organize our ideas and our work to make that happen effectively.

## What is neccessary to complete this proposal

Agreement on the initial checklist items; interim owners/helpers for each of the tasks.
